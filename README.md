# My-CS-Career-Portfolio
Josh Dotson's Computer Science Career Portfolio

Here, you will find a "declassified" versions of many programs I have made in the last couple years. Unfortunatly, due to the fact that my company, SSDesign LLC, used a series privately hosted (by us) SVN repositories for version control, much of the actual progress documenting my work on these projects is absent. In the future, I would like to include in this repository a scrubbed list of our SVN logs to showcase the incredible amount of work that went into building this company's systems single handedly. Less some of Visual Studio's pre-generated project code, and .NET itself, every line, semicolon, and concept was 100% engineered, designed, implemented, and tested by myself alone.

Much of my work included here will not be able to be compiled manually from say, Visual Studio, as many of these projects are commercially viable, and therefore, have been scrubbed of any files deemed to harbor potentially confidential information regarding my company's private/copyrighted systems. However, there are precompiled obfuscated binaries of my projects available in their respective folders, as well as links to web resources for our non-clientside projects.
